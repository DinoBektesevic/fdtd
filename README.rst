Simple 1D FDTD solver
=====================

Simple 1D Finite Difference Time Domain solver for 1D Schrodingers equation of a particle interacting with potentials.
Based on Scipy's Cookbook example_, long since not operational. That made me want to reimplement one for fun and
try to see if I can make it more flexible and easier to use. Math based on this_.

I suspect somethings not quite right, but weekend has passed so there we go. See the Jupyter Notebook for examples.
